# dotfiles

### Description
Repo for my customized bash dotfiles for ease of setting up environment on new machines. 
Includes a bash script that will make symbolic links in your home folder so you don't have to manually copy them everytime a change is made.

### Installation
Clone the respository into your '~/' folder, cd into '~/dotfiles/' and run './install-dotfiles'.
You will need to delete the pre-existing files in your home folder as my script will not overwrite existing files.
